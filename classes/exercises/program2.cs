// Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverï¬‚ow post. It should have properties for title, description and the date/time it was created. We should be able to up-vote or down-vote a post. We should also be able to see the current vote value. In the main method, create a post, up-vote and down-vote it a few times and then display the the current vote value.
